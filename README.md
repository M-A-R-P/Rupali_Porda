An online database for Bengali Films and TV programs.

# Requirement Analysis
<p>Films often reflect the nation's culture. Movies started to entertain people hundreds of years ago and grow in popularity day by day. Online databases like imdb.com maintain a database of films & tv shows. This kind of database is helpful for viewers, and those data can also be used for further analysis. But sadly, Bengali movies and related information are rare on those kinds of platforms; moreover, there is no such platform in the Bangla language. So we are interested in making an online database of Bengali movies in the Bangla language, especially for the Bengali people.</p>
